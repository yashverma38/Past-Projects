Tic Tac Toe
===========

Build Version 1.0

|Gaming|  |Initial Projects|  |Practice|

This game was created by me while learning python from udemy. Although there was a much better version of the game present, but I anyway created one by myself from scratch.

How to play
====================

Run the program in either your terminal or cmd. go to the directory of the game and run "python TicTacToe.py" and the game will start

The position of each place is already written on the board. for each step you have to give input for the position. The location will be then filled up by either -1 or -2 for respective player.

In the end the game will tell who won or who lost.

You can edit the game or contribute to it by forking, and sending a pull request after the work.

Thank You!!
